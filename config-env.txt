# step 1:
# Create a virtual environment in the terminal
# If you choose to create a virtual environment manually, use the following command (where ".venv" is the name of the environment folder):

# macOS/Linux
# You may need to run `sudo apt-get install python3-venv` first on Debian-based OSs
python3 -m venv .venv

# Windows
# You can also use `py -3 -m venv .venv`
python -m venv .venv

# step 2:
# activate venv and run the command in terminal:
source ./.venv/bin/activate
pip install openpyxl

# step 3(not neccessary):
# you can view package you installed with the command:
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
